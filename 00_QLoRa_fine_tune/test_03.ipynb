The term “artificial intelligence” is often used to describe machines that mimic “cognitive” functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as “learning” and “problem solving”.\\nAs machines become more capable, mental faculties such as “creativity”, “cognitive biases”, “common sense”, “empathy”, “logic”, “reasoning”, “self-awareness”, “consciousness”, “imagination”, “self-taught learning”, “social intelligence”, and “the ability to learn from experience” become more difficult to distinguish from natural intelligence.\\nThe field was founded on the claim that human intelligence “can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence “can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”\\nArtificial intelligence is sometimes described as the “new” or “third” wave of computing, following machine replacement of humans and programmable machines.\\nThe first wave was the development of electronic computers themselves, starting around 1940. The second wave was the development of software engineering, which led to the creation of the first commercially available electronic computers.\\nThe third wave is the development of artificial intelligence, which has led to the creation of the first commercially available intelligent machines.\\nArtificial intelligence is an interdisciplinary scientific field that seeks to understand the nature, capabilities, and behavior of the human mind.\\nThe term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956, and the field of AI research was established by John McCarthy in 1956.\\nAI research is an interdisciplinary scientific field that seeks to understand the nature, capabilities, and behavior of the human mind.\\nThe field of AI research is a branch of computer science that seeks to create intelligent agents.\\nThe field of AI research is a branch of computer science that seeks to create intelligent']"

There are different types of AI that can be used to perform different tasks. Some of the most common types of AI are:\\n1. Reactive Machines: These machines are able to perform simple tasks such as recognizing images or sounds.\\n2. Limited Memory Machines: These machines are able to store information for a short period of time, but they are not able to learn or adapt to new situations.\\n3. Theory of Mind Machines: These machines are able to understand the thoughts and feelings of other people.\\n4. Self-Aware Machines: These machines are able to understand their own thoughts and feelings.\\n5. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): These machines are able to perform any task that a human can perform.\\nThe future of AI is uncertain, but it is likely that AI will become more intelligent and more capable of performing complex tasks.\\nWhat are the four types of AI?\\nThere are four types of AI: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind,']"
