Limited Memory Machines: These machines are able to store information for a short period of time, but they are not able to learn or adapt to new situations.\\n3. Theory of Mind Machines: These machines are able to understand the thoughts and feelings of other people.\\n4. Self-Aware Machines: These machines are able to understand their own thoughts and feelings.\\n5. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): These machines are able to perform any task that a human can perform.\\nThe future of AI is uncertain, but it is likely that AI will become more intelligent and more capable of performing complex tasks.\\nWhat are the four types of AI?\\nThere are four types of AI: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind,']"
