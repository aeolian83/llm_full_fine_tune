# LLM_practice

-   This repository aims for full fine-tuning (unquantized fine-tuning) of the LLM, with plans to methodically proceed from data preparation, preprocessing, model training, to model uploading.
-   PyTorch will be used as the primary library, and the use of other libraries for distributed training will be indicated separately.
